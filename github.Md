# Github Etiquette

Being an efficent development team goes beyond just coding, we all have to work together to build a streamlined development process. One area of that process is Github. The following content will go over what it takes to maximize on what Github has to offer for teams. Please note that this under the assumption you're connected with the ImagineTech Organization.

## Forked Repos:

All assigned team members to a project will have to fork over a copy to their local machine. No one should work directly with repo's master branch unless specifically assigned to.

## Branches:

As we won't be monitoring how branches are setup in your Forked Copy, however it is recommended to create your branches based off the feature you're working. As for the Mater repo, there will only be two main branches. One is the Main Master and the other is the Development branch. All Pull Requests will be merged onto the Main Master, once the project is ready for deployment, we will use the Development branch.

## Pull Requests:

Before diving in, please understand that Pull Requests aren't just about Merging. At it's core, it's meant to create a open-ended discussion on why you believe your code should be mergered into Main Master. If your request is denied, do not take it as insult to you and your coding ablities. For a basic understanding on how and what a Pull Request is, visit this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). Some things to keep in mind when working with PRs:

- All PRs will follow a Forked Master into Main Master merge flow. Once you have finish your commits/goal/feautre from your Forked Repo, you will then perform a PR onto the Main Master.
- We require at least one person to be assigned to review the PR, default is the Team Architect or your Team Lead.
- Make sure PRs are apporiate, if you have a question, or can't figure out a bug then that's not a good reason for a pull request. If you are wanting to imporve a feature/code base or even correct grammer and spelling, then submitting a pull request would be your best bet.
